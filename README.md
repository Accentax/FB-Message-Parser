Facebook has a feature that allows users to download a copy of their data. This is just a small parser to help extract some of that data, specifically from the 'html/messages.htm' file. This parser is built using Beautiful Soup, an excellent html parser for python.

Run "python fb_parser.py" with the 'messages.htm' file in the same directory to export to JSON as proof of concept.

You can download your facebook data [here](https://www.facebook.com/settings)
